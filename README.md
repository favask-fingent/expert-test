Lead Capture Form component.

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Missing Database Save for Leads and Duplicate Confirmation Email Invocation
**File**: src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed  

#### Problem  
Lead data submitted via the form was not being saved to the Supabase "leads" table.  
Additionally, the confirmation email function "send-confirmation" was invoked twice, causing redundant emails to be sent.

#### Root Cause  
The handleSubmit function did not include any code to insert the lead data into the database.  
There was also a duplicate call to send confirmation emails.

#### Fix  
Added a Supabase insert call to save the lead data into the "leads" table before sending the confirmation email.  
Removed the duplicate confirmation email invocation to streamline the process.

#### Impact  
âœ… Leads are now properly saved to the database  
âœ… Confirmation emails are sent only once per submission  
âœ… Improved data integrity and lead tracking  
âœ… Reduced redundant email traffic and improved performance

### 2. Fixed Data Index Handling in Confirmation Email Function

**File**: supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

The confirmation email function had issues correctly handling or logging the email response data index, which could cause problems tracking sent emails or debugging failures.

#### Root Cause

The function did not properly access or log the email response data index, leading to incomplete logs and difficulty in troubleshooting.

#### Fix

Updated the function to correctly access and log the email response data ID from the Resend API response (`emailResponse.data?.id`), improving observability and debugging.

#### Impact

âœ… Improved logging and tracking of sent confirmation emails  
âœ… Easier debugging of email sending issues  
âœ… More reliable email confirmation process
